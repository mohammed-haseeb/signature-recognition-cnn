# Handwritten Signature Recognition using CNNs

This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model for recognizing handwritten signatures. The model performs document analysis and retrieval by classifying signatures into different categories and comparing document similarities.

## Project Overview

This project includes the following components:

- **CNN Model**: Classifies handwritten signatures into 57 categories based on unique characteristics.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Prepares the signature dataset for training the CNN model.
- **Data Augmentation**: Uses Keras `ImageDataGenerator` for real-time data augmentation to improve model generalization.
- **Document Similarity Analysis**: Preprocesses text files and calculates the Jaccard similarity index to compare document summaries.
- **Technologies/Libraries Used**: Python, NumPy, Keras, TensorFlow, Gensim
